# Apiculture "Game of life" simulation 

## Description
This project, developed during the Object-Oriented Programming module at CPE Lyon, aims to create an ecosystem simulation featuring various agents such as bees, hornets, trees, etc. The ecosystem evolves over time with interactions between the agents.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several Java classes representing different ecosystem elements and agents. Key classes include `World`, `Agent`, `Bee`, `Hornet`, etc.

## Main Features
- Movement and interaction of agents.
- Management of bee populations in a hive.
- Simulation of hornet hunting and interactions between agents.
- Graphical display of the ecosystem with a user interface.
