# Apiculture "Game of Life" Simulation 

## Description
This project, developed during the Object-Oriented Programming module at CPE Lyon, presents a comprehensive ecosystem simulation featuring various agents like bees, hornets, trees, etc. The project emphasizes dynamic interactions between these agents, creating a realistic and evolving ecosystem.

## Project Structure
The project comprises several Java classes representing different ecosystem elements and agents, fostering a modular and well-organized codebase. Key classes include `World`, `Agent`, `Bee`, `Hornet`, etc.

## Main Features
- **Agent Movement and Interaction:** Simulated the nuanced movement and interaction behaviors of agents, contributing to the complexity of the ecosystem dynamics.
- **Bee Hive Population Dynamics:** Implemented a sophisticated model for bee hive populations, considering factors such as reproduction, resource gathering, and environmental conditions.
- **Hornet Hunting Strategies:** Developed intricate hunting strategies for hornets, taking into account their prey's behavior and environmental factors.
- **Resource Management:** Introduced resource elements such as flowers and trees, affecting agent behavior and contributing to the overall ecosystem balance.

## Graphical Interface
- **Elegant UI Design:** Crafted a visually appealing graphical interface that enhances the user experience.
- **Start and Stop Controls:** Integrated start and stop buttons for convenient user interaction.
- **Realistic Image Rendering:** Implemented a robust image rendering mechanism for agents, providing a lifelike representation within the simulation.
